## GraphQL + Spring Boot example application

This is a Spring Boot based GraphQL sample application written in Kotlin.

You can use this example to easily setup your own GraphQL application.

This project consists of two (maven) modules:

- stubs: containing Spring Cloud Contract files for generation of WireMock stubs
- application: GraphQL example application written in Kotlin using GraphQL Java Tools and the `com.graphql-java-kickstart` and the provided Spring Boot started modules: `graphql-spring-boot-starter`.

### Getting started with GraphQL and Spring Boot

- Create project a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer
- Add graphql-spring-boot-starters


### Queries and mutations

Example query:

```
query {
  orderById(id: "1") {
    totalPrice
    items {
      status
      productId
    }
  }
}
```

Example slow query:

```
query {
  orderById(id: "1") {
    totalPrice
    items {
      status
      productId
      product {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example mutation query:

```
mutation {
  cancelOrderItem(orderItemCancellation: {orderId: "1", orderItemId: "1", reason: "I dont want it!"} ) {
    id
    status
  }
}
```
